reviewboard_together
====================

Review Board is a web-based code review tool that takes the pain out of code review.

[Mozilla Labs' TogetherJS](http://togetherjs.com/) (formerly TowTruck) makes it easy to let the viewers of a web page
chat with one another - either via text, or over WebRTC with their microphones.

reviewboard_together is an extension for Review Board that lets users chat via TogetherJS.

## I installed the extension. Why isn't it working?

Currently, this extension only works with Review Board 1.7.15 and higher. Make sure your Review Board instance is up to date.
